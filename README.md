# shsscripts

Here are two scripts that I worked on! One of them was for automating the Practice Partners program, and the other one was for automating the Signifer program. Neither of them was 100% foolproof, so there was some manual checks that went along with them, and they were each customized to the spreadsheet we worked with. For the sake of privacy, I can't attach the unsorted or sorted spreadsheets, since they all contain personal information.

I'm sure there is a more efficient way of going about this, but that remains to be seen. Even though the code behind them is "simple," I am still satisfied with the results.
